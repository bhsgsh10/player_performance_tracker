# player_performance_tracker
**@PlayerTracker2** is a Twitter bot to allow users to track the performance and conversation around their favorite soccer players. While there are many apps and websites that have performance data on soccer players, a Twitter bot is less intrusive and can be tailored to send updates for only the updates a user has subscribed for. It can also be viewed as a reporting aid as it sends out updates on statistics of players after each game.

Go to https://twitter.com/PlayerTracker2 to view the list of players you can get updates for. To track a player tweet the following: '@PlayerTracker2 track <player name>'. To stop getting updates tweet '@PlayerTracker2 stop'.
